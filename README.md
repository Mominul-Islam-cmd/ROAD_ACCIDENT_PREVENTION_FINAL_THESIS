# ROAD_ACCIDENT_PREVENTION_FINAL_THESIS


Developed a deep learning-based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze road images and
classify road conditions into three categories: Severely risky, Mildly risky, and Normal.
• Achieved an accuracy of 95.5% in detecting problematic road conditions through the application of deep learning
techniques.
• Implemented a mobile application that enables real-time crowdsourced data collection of road conditions and
facilitates sharing information among users, contributing to accident prevention and raising awareness among
drivers.
• Utilized crowdsourced data to update the trained model, further enhancing the accuracy of the road condition
classifier
