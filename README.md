# ROAD_ACCIDENT_PREVENTION_FINAL_THESIS


Introduction
Road conditions play a critical role in ensuring the safety of drivers. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to classify road conditions accurately and in real-time. The approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process images of roads and categorize them into three distinct classes:

Severely Risky
Mildly Risky
Normal
Features
High Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 95.5% in detecting problematic road conditions.
Real-time Data Collection: Implemented a mobile application that enables real-time crowdsourced data collection.
Community Sharing: Facilitates sharing of road condition information among users.
Model Updates: Utilizes crowdsourced data to update the trained model, enhancing classification accuracy over time.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model comprises a variety of road images labeled into the three categories mentioned above. The data collection process is facilitated through the mobile application, ensuring diverse and up-to-date inputs.

Model
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture well-suited for image classification tasks. The training process involves:

Preprocessing the images.
Training the CNN model on the labeled dataset.
Evaluating the model's performance.
Updating the model using new data collected via the mobile application.
Mobile Application
The mobile application is a crucial component of the system, enabling users to:

Collect and upload road condition images in real-time.
View and share road condition updates.
Receive notifications about hazardous road conditions.
